---- Function Prototypes

 Initializes the maze according to the width and height passed in.  The width and height should both be
 greater than 8.  The width should also be less than 80 and the height should be less than 26.

 The start of the maze is always in the upper left of the maze at coordinates (1, 1) and is marked with
 an 'S'.  Likewise the exit or end of the maze is always in the lower right corner and marked with an
 'E'.  The coordinates of the exit vary since mazes of different sizes may be used
bool maze_init(int width, int height);

 Gets the width of the maze.  This and the following function both return -1 in case of an error.  This
 could be caused by calling either of these functions before calling maze_init().
int  maze_get_width(void);

 Gets the width of the maze.  This and the following function both return -1 in case of an error.  This
 could be caused by calling either of these functions before calling maze_init().
int  maze_get_height(void);

 returns true if the coordinate supplied is within the bounds of the maze and false otherwise.
bool maze_is_coord_in_bounds(int x, int y);

 Returns the character in the maze at a given coordinate.  A return value of '#' represents a wall, 'S'
 represents the starting place of the robot, 'E' represents the exit and ' ' represents an open space.
char maze_get_char(int x, int y);

 This function can be used to set a character in the maze to something new.  It will not set a square
 that's filled with a wall ('#'), the start of the maze marker ('S'), or the end of the maze marker
 ('E').
bool maze_set_char(int x, int y, char new_val);

 This function prints the maze as it currently is
void maze_print(void);
